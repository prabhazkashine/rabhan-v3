# SAMA Credit Replenishment Implementation

## Overview
When users pay monthly installments for BNPL projects, the installment amount is automatically added back to their SAMA credit. This implements a **revolving credit system** where users regain their credit limit as they repay.

---

## How It Works

### Core Principle
**Only amounts borrowed from SAMA credit get replenished. Cash payments (downpayments) do NOT get added back.**

### Example Scenario

#### Initial State:
```
User SAMA Credit: 10,000 SAR
Project Cost: 25,600 SAR
Payment Method: BNPL (10 installments)
```

#### At BNPL Selection (in projects-service):
```
SAMA Credit Deducted: 10,000 SAR (what user had)
Downpayment Required: 15,600 SAR (cash payment to cover shortfall)
User's Remaining SAMA Credit: 0 SAR

Monthly EMI: 10,000 √∑ 10 = 1,000 SAR/month
```

#### Payment Timeline:
```
Month 1: User pays 1,000 SAR
  ‚Üí Installment marked as paid ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí 1,000 SAR added to SAMA credit
  ‚Üí New SAMA Credit: 1,000 SAR

Month 2: User pays 1,000 SAR
  ‚Üí Installment marked as paid ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí 1,000 SAR added to SAMA credit
  ‚Üí New SAMA Credit: 2,000 SAR

...

Month 10: User pays 1,000 SAR (final installment)
  ‚Üí Installment marked as paid ‚úÖ
  ‚Üí 1,000 SAR added to SAMA credit
  ‚Üí New SAMA Credit: 10,000 SAR (fully restored!)
```

## Implementation Details

### File: `src/services/payment.service.ts`

**Function:** `payInstallment()` - Line 256-290

```typescript
// After successfully processing the installment payment...

// Replenish SAMA credit for BNPL payments
if (installment.payment.payment_method === 'bnpl') {
  try {
    await updateUserSamaCredit(
      userId,
      installmentAmount, // Only base amount, NOT late fees
      'add',
      projectId,
      `Installment #${installment.installment_number} paid...`
    );

    logger.info('SAMA credit replenished after installment payment', {
      userId,
      projectId,
      installmentNumber: installment.installment_number,
      amountReplenished: installmentAmount,
      lateFeeNotReplenished: lateFee,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error but don't fail the payment
    logger.error('Failed to replenish SAMA credit...', {...});
  }
}
```

### Key Features:

1. **Only BNPL Payments** - Checks if `payment_method === 'bnpl'`
2. **Base Amount Only** - Replenishes `installmentAmount`, NOT late fees
3. **Non-Blocking** - If credit update fails, payment still succeeds
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Tracks successes and failures

---

## User Service Integration

### Required User Service Endpoint

**PATCH** `/api/users/:userId/sama-credit`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "operation": "add",
  "projectId": "uuid-here",
  "reason": "Installment #1 paid for project abc-123. Replenishing 1000 SAR to SAMA credit."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "SAMA credit updated successfully",
  "data": {
    "previousAmount": 0,
    "newAmount": 1000,
    "operation": "add"
  }
}
```

### User Service Implementation (Expected)

The user service should:
1. Validate the user exists
2. Get current `samaCreditAmount`
3. Add the amount: `newAmount = currentAmount + amount`
4. Update the user record
5. Log the transaction for audit trail
6. Return the updated amounts

---

## Important Rules

### ‚úÖ What Gets Replenished:
- **Installment base amount** - The amount deducted from SAMA credit
- **BNPL payments only** - Not single-pay transactions
- **Successful payments** - Only after payment is confirmed

### ‚ùå What Does NOT Get Replenished:
- **Late fees** - These are penalties, not borrowed amounts
- **Downpayments** - These were cash payments, not SAMA credit
- **Failed payments** - No replenishment if payment fails
- **Single-pay transactions** - These don't use SAMA credit

---

## Late Fee Handling

### Example with Late Payment:
```
Installment Amount: 1,000 SAR
Overdue Days: 14 days (2 weeks)
Late Fee: 20 SAR (2% penalty)
Total Payment: 1,020 SAR

User Pays: 1,020 SAR
Amount Replenished to SAMA: 1,000 SAR (NOT 1,020)

Why? Late fees are penalties and shouldn't restore credit.
```

---

## Error Handling

### Strategy: Non-Blocking
If SAMA credit update fails, the installment payment still succeeds because:
1. User paid successfully (payment gateway confirmed)
2. Installment is marked as paid in database
3. SAMA credit update is a **separate concern**

### What Happens on Failure:
1. ‚úÖ Payment transaction completes
2. ‚úÖ Installment marked as paid
3. ‚úÖ Project status updated if needed
4. ‚ùå SAMA credit NOT updated
5. üìù Error logged with full details

### Recovery Options:
- **Manual Admin Intervention** - Admin can manually adjust credit
- **Retry Mechanism** - Could implement background job to retry
- **Alert System** - Notify admins of failed credit updates

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Successful Payment with Credit Replenishment
```json
Scenario:
- User has 0 SAR SAMA credit (already deducted at BNPL selection)
- Pays installment of 1,000 SAR
- No late fees

Expected Result:
‚úÖ Payment succeeds
‚úÖ Installment marked as paid
‚úÖ SAMA credit increased by 1,000 SAR
‚úÖ New SAMA credit balance: 1,000 SAR

Logs:
- "Installment paid"
- "SAMA credit replenished after installment payment"
```

### Test Case 2: Late Payment with Fee
```json
Scenario:
- User has 2,000 SAR SAMA credit
- Pays installment of 1,000 SAR + 50 SAR late fee = 1,050 SAR

Expected Result:
‚úÖ Payment of 1,050 SAR succeeds
‚úÖ Installment marked as paid (with late_fee: 50)
‚úÖ SAMA credit increased by 1,000 SAR (NOT 1,050)
‚úÖ New SAMA credit balance: 3,000 SAR

Logs:
- "amountReplenished": 1000
- "lateFeeNotReplenished": 50
```

### Test Case 3: User Service Unavailable
```json
Scenario:
- User pays 1,000 SAR installment
- User service is down/unreachable

Expected Result:
‚úÖ Payment succeeds (user charged successfully)
‚úÖ Installment marked as paid
‚ùå SAMA credit NOT updated
üìù Error logged: "Failed to replenish SAMA credit after installment payment"

Impact:
- User sees payment success (correct)
- Admin needs to manually adjust SAMA credit later
```

### Test Case 4: Final Installment Payment
```json
Scenario:
- User pays final (10th) installment of 1,000 SAR
- Current SAMA credit: 9,000 SAR

Expected Result:
‚úÖ Payment succeeds
‚úÖ All installments now paid
‚úÖ Project status ‚Üí "payment_completed"
‚úÖ SAMA credit increased by 1,000 SAR
‚úÖ Final SAMA credit: 10,000 SAR (fully restored!)

Timeline Entry:
- "Installment 10 Paid" event created
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Queue failed credit updates
   - Background job retries every 5 minutes
   - Give up after 5 attempts, alert admin

2. **Webhook System**
   - User service sends webhook on credit update
   - Payment service verifies update succeeded

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Show failed credit updates
   - Provide manual retry button
   - Audit trail of all credit changes

4. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Notify user when credit is replenished
   - SMS/email: "Your SAMA credit has been restored by 1,000 SAR"

5. **Credit History Tracking**
   - Store all credit transactions in separate table
   - Track: deductions, replenishments, manual adjustments
   - Generate statements for users

## Support

### Common Issues:

**Q: User paid installment but credit not updated**
- Check logs for "Failed to replenish SAMA credit"
- Verify user service is running
- Manually update credit via admin panel

**Q: Should downpayment be added to SAMA credit?**
- **NO!** Downpayment is cash, not borrowed from SAMA
- Only installment amounts get replenished

**Q: What about late fees?**
- Late fees are penalties, not replenished to SAMA credit
- Only base installment amount gets added back

**Q: Payment failed but credit was added?**
- This shouldn't happen - credit update is AFTER payment success
- If it does, indicates a race condition bug - report to dev team
