## Project Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Creation
1. User selects approved contractor quote
2. System creates project with `payment_pending` status

### Phase 2: Payment Selection
1. User chooses payment method:
   - **Single Pay**: Full amount in one payment
   - **BNPL**: Downpayment + monthly installments
2. System generates payment schedule (for BNPL)
3. Status ‚Üí `payment_processing`

### Phase 3: Payment Processing

**Single Pay:**
1. User pays full amount (mock payment)
2. Payment received ‚Üí Status: `payment_completed`
3. Ready for installation

**BNPL:**
1. Optional: User pays downpayment
2. Admin pays full amount to contractor
3. User pays monthly installments
4. Each installment tracked separately
5. Late fees applied for overdue payments

### Phase 4: Installation
1. Contractor schedules installation ‚Üí Status: `installation_scheduled`
2. Contractor starts work ‚Üí Status: `installation_in_progress`
3. Contractor completes work ‚Üí Triggers OTP to user
4. User receives OTP via SMS
5. User verifies completion with OTP ‚Üí Status: `installation_completed`

### Phase 5: Review & Completion
1. User submits rating and review
2. Contractor can respond to review
3. Project marked as `completed`

## Payment Calculations

### BNPL Example
```typescript
Total Amount: 50,000 SAR
Downpayment: 10,000 SAR (optional)
Months: 12

Remaining: 50,000 - 10,000 = 40,000 SAR
Monthly EMI: 40,000 / 12 = 3,333.33 SAR

Installment Schedule:
- Month 1: 3,333.33 SAR (due: Feb 1, 2025)
- Month 2: 3,333.33 SAR (due: Mar 1, 2025)
- ...
- Month 12: 3,333.38 SAR (due: Jan 1, 2026)
```

### Late Fees
- 1% per week overdue
- Maximum 10% of installment amount

## OTP Verification Flow

1. Contractor completes installation
2. System generates 6-digit OTP
3. OTP sent to user's mobile via SMS (mock in dev)
4. OTP valid for 10 minutes
5. User has 3 attempts to enter correct OTP
6. Upon successful verification:
   - Installation marked as verified
   - Project status updated
   - Review request sent to user

## Mock Payment System

For development, the service uses a mock payment gateway:

```typescript
// 95% success rate
const paymentResult = await processMockPayment(amount, method, userId);

if (paymentResult.success) {
  // Payment successful
  // Reference: PAY-ABC123XYZ
}
```

## Logging

All operations are logged with Winston:

```typescript
logger.info('Project created', {
  projectId,
  userId,
  totalAmount,
  paymentMethod
});

logger.error('Payment failed', {
  projectId,
  error: error.message
});
```

Logs stored in:
- `logs/error.log` - Errors only
- `logs/combined.log` - All logs

## Validation

All inputs validated with Zod schemas:

```typescript
const createProjectSchema = z.object({
  quote_id: z.string().uuid(),
  preferred_installation_date: z.string().datetime().optional(),
  project_name: z.string().min(3).max(200).optional(),
});
```

## Error Handling

Custom error classes:
- `ValidationError` (400)
- `NotFoundError` (404)
- `BusinessRuleError` (422)
- `PaymentError` (402)
- `ConflictError` (409)
